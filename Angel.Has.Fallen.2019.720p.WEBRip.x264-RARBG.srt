1
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,743
Target is on the move.

2
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,497
Target,
third floor, south corridor.

3
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,879
Target moving!
Third floor! North corridor.

4
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,785
He just dropped
to the second level!

5
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,922
All teams circle out and move!

6
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,782
This is Air One.

7
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,350
We still have no visual
on the target.

8
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,445
All teams push down!

9
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,813
Move, move!

10
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,815
Don't let him get to
the extraction point!

11
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,588
- Move it, move it!
- Push, push!

12
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,357
Move, move, move!

13
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,330
Ah!

14
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,498
Fuck!

15
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,968
Actual to Com. Secure for drill.

16
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,736
In the fucking heart.

17
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:01,306
Air One, you're clear to land.

18
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,644
You got me.

19
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:06,812
So, what do you think?

20
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:09,414
I think I'm fucking dead.

21
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,986
Mike, this course,
nobody makes it that far.

22
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,354
Don't bullshit me.

23
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,491
- Thanks for letting me use that.
- Yeah, no sweat.

24
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,893
So, where the hell did you
find this place, anyway?

25
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,529
During the Cold War,
they used to make cruise missiles.

26
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,332
I bought it for next to
nothing from Uncle Sam.

27
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,602
Turned Salient Global
into a 5,000-acre Disneyland.

28
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,705
You can come up with any scenario you
want here and put it to the test, bud.

29
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,474
Any scenario.

30
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,975
Yeah, it's a hell of a layout.

31
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,810
Hey!

32
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,545
- What the fuck, asshole?
- Whoa, whoa.

33
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,414
He just kicked me
down the fucking stairs.

34
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,449
Well, don't stand on
the fucking stairs.

35
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,851
You fucking winding me up?

36
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,319
Hey, you don't train like it's real,

37
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,954
then you're dead when it is.

38
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,856
Cool it, Bruno.

39
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:51,990
We're all friends here.

40
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:57,663
Seems like a nice guy.

41
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,331
Yeah.

42
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,367
So, I went off
and bought a house,

43
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,603
and you bought
a small city in Virginia.

44
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:07,839
Well, as they say,
looks can be deceiving.

45
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,444
When DOD shut down
everyone's contracting gigs

46
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,945
after the Blackwater shit
happened,

47
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,048
it crippled my business.

48
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,618
All I got keeping Salient
afloat are training contracts.

49
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:24,356
The word is
David Gentry's retiring...

50
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,825
and you're on the deck
to take over.

51
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,395
Director of Secret Service, huh?

52
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,031
And here I just thought you missed me.

53
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:39,938
Well, if I can get a contract for
your special ops to train here,

54
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,773
it'd finally get me
out of the red.

55
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:45,377
Look, let me see what I can do.

56
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,614
Okay? I'll bring it up to Gentry,
or whoever the new director is.

57
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,982
Hey, that's all I'm asking.

58
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:52,951
- All right, buddy.
- Thanks, Mike.

59
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:59,958
- Hey, when are you in DC next?
- Well, when do you need me?

60
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,561
I'm just saying, it'd be nice
of you to come over, you know.

61
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,995
Meet the family.

62
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,498
Throw on some steaks,
sit out back, tell lies.

63
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,434
Sure, I'd like that.
Just say when.

64
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,569
See you, bud.

65
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,150
Leah?

66
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,065
- Hey, hon.
- How was the range?

67
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,901
Ah, easy breezy.

68
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,170
My friend Wade's got
a good thing going.

69
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,173
Bummed I missed Lynne.

70
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,475
How many stories
did it take this time?

71
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,776
The usual four.

72
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,479
You gonna take a shower?

73
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,914
No.

74
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,715
No, I just washed the sheets.
I just...

75
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,151
You smell like gunpowder.

76
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,686
Yeah, you know you love it.

77
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,024
"Modern Nursing," huh?

78
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:43,228
What, you thinking
about going back to work early?

79
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,629
I'm thinking about it.

80
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,632
But it's like she does
something so amazing every day,

81
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't wanna miss it.

82
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,238
Pretty soon we're gonna have
you around here too more, right?

83
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:58,143
Yeah. He hasn't made
a decision yet, honey.

84
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,744
If you want me to,

85
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,680
I will march down
to the White House

86
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,114
and set Trumbull straight.

87
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,084
Yeah. Think that'll work?

88
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,686
I can be pretty persuasive.

89
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,521
Trust me, I know.

90
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:12,557
Leah, we have
a good life already.

91
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,279
So I'm just saying, you know,
I'm not gonna get all worried about it.

92
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,102
So, how long
after this last concussion

93
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,272
did the migraines
and the dizziness start?

94
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,874
Pretty much right away.

95
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,810
And you said
it was from a car accident?

96
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:34,813
Yeah.

97
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,015
When did the insomnia start?

98
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,651
Well, I've always had a little.

99
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:41,953
Comes with the job, I guess.

100
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,022
What line of work are you in?

101
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,590
Computer sales.

102
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,593
Yeah, I travel a lot.

103
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,766
Mr. Jameson, you need
to be a lot more careful.

104
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:59,938
I'm seeing severe compression
between C3 through 5 in your neck,

105
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,541
possible spinal cord damage.

106
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,010
You're a disaster
waiting to happen.

107
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,651
Pathfinder's moving.

108
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,296
Just a few more of these pressers
and I'm done with this circus.

109
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,798
Ah, you know
you'll miss it, sir.

110
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,266
You have no life.

111
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,070
Says the man who could be taking my place.

112
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,339
Mr. President? Mr. President?
Helen.

113
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:38,276
Mr. President, you promised to
amend the AUMF War Powers Resolution

114
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,745
to require approval
from Congress

115
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,015
before committing US military
forces to further conflicts.

116
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,585
- Is that still your intention?
- It is.

117
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:50,188
We've become complacent
to war in this country.

118
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,693
I intend to change that by making
it our last, but clear, option.

119
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,094
Yeah, Steve.

120
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,330
Mr. President,
with Russia continuing

121
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,299
to extend its military
well beyond its borders,

122
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:05,670
what is your strategy to stop them
from reforming the old Soviet Union?

123
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:08,607
Well, you'll know where I
stand on that issue at the G20.

124
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,643
There are rumors in the White
House that your new foreign policy

125
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,613
will broaden the use
of private contractors

126
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,983
to help bolster American troops,
who remain scattered around the globe.

127
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,784
Is there any truth to that?

128
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,055
That's all for today, folks.
Thank you very much.

129
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,291
Mr. President! Mr. President!

130
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,194
I swear,
these walls have more leaks

131
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,763
than a submarine
with a screen door.

132
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,099
It wasn't me.

133
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,001
You sure?

134
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,238
- I'm sure.
- Okay.

135
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,643
Who, once again,
leaked false info to the press.

136
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,077
Thank you, Sam.

137
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,049
I thought I made my position clear
about private contractor companies

138
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,350
during the election.

139
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:57,722
I am tired, sick and tired,

140
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,025
of a handful of people
profiting from our mission.

141
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,427
Hell, half these guys
aren't even American.

142
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,298
It's not the same fighting for money
as when you fight for your flag.

143
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,435
Now, enough with the leaks.
Who's talking?

144
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,707
Nobody's fessing up, huh?

145
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,742
Of course not.

146
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:20,679
Well, let me be clear.

147
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,147
It is not our troops' fault

148
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,082
that they are stretched so thin.

149
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,252
It's our fault.

150
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:30,188
The status quo has gone on
long enough.

151
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,956
It's time for a new way forward.

152
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,127
Well, I haven't done one
of these for a while.

153
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,762
- Oh, God.
- I forgot about that.

154
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,397
What are you doing?

155
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,099
- You still doing this?
- Here we go.

156
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,934
You got to see this, babe.
It's very funny.

157
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,469
Yeah, well,
I wasn't much of a card player,

158
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,404
so I had to find a way
to spend the time.

159
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:49,140
- Mike said you grew up in England?
- Yeah, I did.

160
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,743
Yeah, my father was an expat.
I...

161
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,912
I never really felt
I belonged anywhere.

162
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,081
But when I moved to the States
after school, I joined the army.

163
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,016
And how long did you guys
serve together?

164
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,251
I got into Third Batt
right after you.

165
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,120
- So, what, about three, four years?
- That sounds about right. Yeah.

166
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,255
Mike never tells me stories
about his army days.

167
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,757
Yeah, well, most of us don't.

168
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:08,293
It's just our way, I guess.

169
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:12,731
- But, hey, if you wanna hear a story...
- No.

170
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,466
- Yeah.
- No, she doesn't wanna hear a story.

171
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,368
No, whatever he's gonna say
is definitely inappropriate.

172
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,137
- All right.
- Oh, God.

173
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,140
Well, army cooks aren't
exactly culinary giants.

174
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,175
So we used to go
to this restaurant

175
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:27,145
that made the best fried
chicken that you've ever had.

176
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,980
And we'd eat baskets full.

177
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:33,818
And the cook,
he was this great old guy called Moe.

178
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,954
- Moe.
- Moe had to walk to work.

179
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,257
Five miles to work and five miles back.
Rain or shine.

180
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:43,394
Now, you can fry an egg on a
Georgia sidewalk in the summer.

181
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:47,298
So Mike went to every man in the
company, with a duffel bag,

182
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,968
and asked 'em
to put some money in, or else.

183
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,238
Now, your husband,
he can be pretty stubborn.

184
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,140
Yeah, tell me about it.

185
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,208
So Mike didn't quit

186
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,145
until every single one of them
emptied their wallets.

187
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,981
And do you know
what your daddy did?

188
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:07,418
Bought Moe a car so he didn't
have to walk to work anymore.

189
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,790
Mike Banning's one of the most
bullheaded men I've ever met.

190
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:16,027
No way was he gonna let
old Moe down.

191
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,130
Here. There you go, sweetheart.

192
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,899
That's for you. Say thank you.

193
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,570
Here.

194
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,005
Drink that, please,

195
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,206
and shut up.

196
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,476
Did you ever think
we'd live past 30?

197
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,512
No. Not back then, anyway.

198
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,980
Hell, I miss it.

199
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,917
The smoking,
the joking with the guys...

200
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,019
the adrenaline, the fighting.

201
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,558
You okay?

202
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,127
Yeah.

203
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:52,230
You sure?

204
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,366
Hey, can I be honest with you?

205
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,572
I don't think I'm gonna take the
director's job if they offer it.

206
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,441
God, I'm not ready
to ride a desk yet.

207
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,877
I saw it in your eyes
the moment I mentioned it.

208
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,912
Hell, I wouldn't either.

209
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,283
We're lions.

210
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,386
And that ain't never
gonna change.

211
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,124
Tell you what, though...

212
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,262
I'll put in a good word for you
when they pick the new director.

213
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,864
Only if it's convenient.

214
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,933
To Moe.

215
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,468
To Moe.

216
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,540
Analysts are concerned

217
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,042
that the buildup of
Russian forces...

218
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,510
I thought
you could only fit four.

219
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,946
Oh, thanks, I do want some.

220
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,149
I made some breakfast.
You want some?

221
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,618
No, babe, I got to go.
I'll get some at the office.

222
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,086
Hey, you.

223
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,390
Chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka.
Hey.

224
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,491
I still got it.

225
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:31,329
You look exhausted. I know you
didn't sleep again last night, and...

226
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,165
Babe... I'm okay.

227
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,600
Can we just talk about this
for five minutes?

228
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,368
- I got to go.
- You're not that late.

229
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,939
I will see you
in a few days, okay?

230
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,340
We'll talk about it
when you get back.

231
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,309
We'll talk about it
when I get back.

232
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,443
I promise.

233
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,019
All right, Lynnie-pin.

234
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,022
- Can you say bye-bye?
- Bye, Lynnie-pin.

235
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,624
Ah, ooh, good!

236
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,530
We're all set, Sector One.

237
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:07,131
All clear, Sector Two.

238
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,433
Pathfinder inbound.

239
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,406
All units be advised,
Pathfinder Alpha.

240
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,544
Command post,
get your middle perimeter all clear.

241
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,680
Right, man.
I'll be in with a few beers tonight.

242
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,749
But that's it. Starting today,
you're buying everything.

243
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:27,285
Command post mid,
inner perimeter all clear.

244
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,021
Command post
ADVICED: The outer, middle

245
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,689
and inner perimeters all clear.

246
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,725
Banning copies.

247
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,397
You must really like fishing, sir.

248
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,666
It's cold as shit out here.

249
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,001
Sorry.

250
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,138
Anything to get out of DC
for a while.

251
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,443
Just don't know
who to trust anymore.

252
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,546
Anyhoo.

253
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,281
Whose idea was it

254
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,450
for you to throw your hat
in the ring for director,

255
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,685
yours or Leah's?

256
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,687
- Oh, mine, sir.
- Hmm.

257
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,123
Well, for her.

258
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,658
For me too.

259
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,097
It was... mine too.

260
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,739
Don't think I've ever
seen you so nervous.

261
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,171
Look, sir, if I'm not the...

262
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,608
I think it's a great idea for
you to pick up the torch, Mike.

263
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:26,377
So...

264
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,746
I am selecting you for director.

265
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,083
Congratulations.

266
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,821
I'll...
I'll give it my best shot, sir.

267
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,257
Thank you.

268
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,459
That's what I was afraid of.

269
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,562
- What's that, sir?
- That look in your eye.

270
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,764
Like I just handed you
a death sentence.

271
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,772
Oh, if I had my way, sir, I would
keep hard-charging to the day I die.

272
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,774
But that's not realistic.

273
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:00,745
Give it a few days.

274
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:05,116
Talk it over with Leah,
and we'll go from there. Okay?

275
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,118
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

276
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,192
Hey. Hey!

277
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,160
You all right?

278
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,397
I just need to rehydrate.

279
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,798
Why don't you get somebody
to cover for you?

280
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,834
No, sir. I'm good. I'm okay.

281
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:26,170
Mike... I'm fine.

282
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,474
Go. You're scaring my damn fish.

283
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,643
They're frozen, anyway.

284
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:35,446
Go. Smart-ass.

285
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,747
Murph, it's Banning.

286
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,817
Hey, can you give me a push?

287
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,452
Roger. I'm on my way.

288
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,715
Banning's on his way.

289
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,351
Come in...

290
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,290
What is that? Are they bats?

291
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,478
Drones! They're drones!

292
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,947
Murph... Come with me, sir.

293
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:17,615
Get him under
the ballistic hard cover

294
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,897
and keep him down.
I'm on my way.

295
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,459
Delta Team, engage. Engage.

296
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,974
Don't move. Don't move.
They're tracking us somehow.

297
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,843
Just hold still
and keep him covered, Murph.

298
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,311
I'm coming to you.

299
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,295
Move back! Take the shot!

300
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,836
Bravo Team is down.
Bravo team...

301
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:12,937
They're too small!

302
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,096
Backup team, move to Pathfinder.

303
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,719
Open fire! Open fire!

304
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,757
- Shoot those motherfuckers!
- There's too many!

305
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,554
Get down!

306
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,709
Fuck!

307
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:27,878
Oh, my God.

308
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:37,121
They're coming at you, Murph.
Get him in the water.

309
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,556
The hard cover isn't enough.

310
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,824
- What about you?
- Go!

311
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,709
Sir, I got you.

312
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,515
Okay, sir, we're going under.
Dive deep.

313
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,593
We're getting disturbing reports

314
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,828
that there's been an assassination
attempt on the president.

315
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,765
We're getting
reports of a drone strike.

316
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,927
A backup Marine One
has been called to extract the president.

317
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,839
Alpha 17, this is Hawk 5.

318
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,776
We are approaching Saint
Matthews with Pathfinder.

319
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,811
One-fifty over 90.

320
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,725
We don't have
many confirmed details yet,

321
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,761
but it appears that
President Allan Trumbull

322
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,864
has had an assassination
attempt on his life

323
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,766
while on a fishing trip today.

324
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,135
We expect to receive
more details soon,

325
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,171
- including the staggering death toll...
- Oh. Come on.

326
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:02,206
On his Secret Service
protection team.

327
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,697
Mr. President, can you hear me?

328
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,170
Agent Banning, stay with me.

329
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,576
Is everything secure?

330
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,079
Okay,
I want the president in Suite B,

331
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,014
and I want Banning
over here in the ward.

332
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,836
Hey, Johnson.
You're coming with me. Come on.

333
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:11,642
Peterson. Make sure HRT
has that lake secured. Got it?

334
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:12,743
Yeah.

335
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,015
Mr. Vice President, this way.

336
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:29,894
How is he?

337
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,729
Well, he was already
in a comatose state

338
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,731
when he arrived on Marine One.

339
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,633
We were told
there were heavy explosions,

340
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,801
but we're not seeing any signs

341
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,070
of swelling
from traumatic brain damage,

342
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:41,805
which is great news.

343
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,041
Now it's a waiting game.

344
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,046
And the security detail?

345
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:51,081
Only one survived, sir.

346
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:56,120
Mike Banning.
The others died on scene.

347
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,060
And what's Banning's status?

348
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,029
He was also unconscious
when he arrived,

349
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,131
but he's already showing
signs of response.

350
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:12,102
We expect him to be alert soon,
and then we'll run some more tests.

351
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,204
When you're ready, sir.

352
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,041
I'll need to see you outside.

353
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,755
Sir.

354
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:35,926
This is Judge Spier of the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

355
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,262
She will swear you in
as acting president.

356
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,769
All right.
Let's hope this is only a formality.

357
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,839
Mr. Vice President,
if you'll place your hand on the Bible...

358
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:53,310
and raise your right hand,
and repeat after me.

359
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,715
"I, Martin James Kirby,
do solemnly swear..."

360
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:03,020
I, Martin James Kirby,
do solemnly swear...

361
00:27:03,022 --> 00:27:05,656
"that I will faithfully execute"

362
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:08,258
"the office of president
of the United States..."

363
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,095
That I will faithfully execute

364
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,831
the office of president
of the United States...

365
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,734
"and will to
the best of my ability..."

366
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,970
And will to
the best of my ability...

367
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,708
"preserve, protect and defend
the Constitution of the United States."

368
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:32,883
preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States.

369
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:35,986
- "So help me God."
- So help me God.

370
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,125
Ramirez.

371
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,395
All right. Hold, hold.

372
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,030
Local police found a van

373
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:47,798
a mile to the north
full of electronics gear.

374
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,999
Some kind of launcher system.

375
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,134
Tell 'em don't touch a thing

376
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,702
until our people get there.

377
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,303
On it.
All right, secure the area.

378
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,838
All right, let's work.

379
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,189
Move there, please.
We'll check you in two at a time.

380
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,824
Two forward. Let's go.

381
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,130
David, thank God. Is he okay?

382
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,832
He's in the ICU.

383
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:24,802
But I'm sorry,
that's all I can tell you right now.

384
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:27,905
- Come on.
- What? Tell me what happened to my husband, David.

385
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:30,307
Leah, you need to come with me.
Okay?

386
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,244
Come on. I'll get you a room
where you and Lynne can rest.

387
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,471
Why am I in cuffs?

388
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:05,075
I'm Special Agent Helen
Thompson with the FBI.

389
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,178
Can you tell me your name?
Who you work for?

390
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,382
My name is Mike Banning,
Secret Service.

391
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,184
Where... Where am I?

392
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,020
And why am I being secured?

393
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,057
You're in
Saint Matthews Hospital.

394
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,892
You remember how you got here?

395
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,995
Just tell me
what the fuck is going on.

396
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,765
- What's the last thing you remember?
- Oh.

397
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,335
Mike, it's very important you tell
me the last thing you remember.

398
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:39,143
Murph.

399
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,112
The president.

400
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,215
Where's the president?
Where is he? Is he okay?

401
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,888
President Trumbull is in a coma,
and your whole team is dead.

402
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,159
Except you.

403
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,095
Tell me how that happened.

404
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,566
- What happened on the lake?
- I need to see the president.

405
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,269
I need to see the president now.

406
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,572
- Not gonna happen.
- I've been sitting here for hours.

407
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,809
No one's telling me what's going on.
My husband's in the ICU...

408
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,076
Leah, I know this is
frustrating for you.

409
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:15,012
I'd like my daughter in here, please.

410
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,547
But I think it's best that
we just let Lynne sleep, okay?

411
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,081
I wanna see my husband.

412
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,416
And I'm working on that for you.

413
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,118
But first...

414
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,888
did you know about the $10
million in the offshore account?

415
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:28,058
- Mike's account.
- Ten million what?

416
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,029
Maybe you can explain why
I found your DNA in the van.

417
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,032
Skin cells, hair.

418
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:37,267
Right there on the launch controls.

419
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,502
What?

420
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,504
Or residue from
the same explosives

421
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,873
used in the event
in your garage.

422
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:47,211
Mike, tell me about the encrypted
folder we found on the dark web.

423
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,412
Encrypted folder?

424
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:49,980
The encrypted folder

425
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,849
that contained
the classified map

426
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:55,285
and your Secret Service
itinerary for the lake trip.

427
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,188
Only you had that, Mike.
How did that happen?

428
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:01,625
Did you know about Mike's
issues with painkillers?

429
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:07,197
How about that he has seen four
different doctors in the last six months,

430
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,233
paying each one of them in cash?

431
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,068
Did you know about that issue?

432
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,939
The controls were left on auto to deploy
the drones during the trip's window.

433
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,109
The facial recognition to target
the president of the United States,

434
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:22,279
as well as every member
of your team, except you.

435
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:24,481
You had this perfectly
planned, Mike, didn't you?

436
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:27,050
Can't you see
that I'm being set up?

437
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,619
No, I cannot, Agent Banning.

438
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:32,155
He's in line to be director
of the Secret Service.

439
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,292
Exactly. Which is why I
believe Mike saw the inevitable

440
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,594
and was looking for
a big payout for you guys.

441
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,665
Now, if that's the case, Leah,
that means somebody paid him to do this.

442
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:47,037
If you can help me find that person,
it would help Mike's case considerably.

443
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,276
Fuck you, lady.

444
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,244
You can't play me.

445
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,581
My husband is a good man.

446
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,583
You're being charged
with the attempted murder

447
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,585
of the president
of the United States,

448
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,455
as well as the premeditated
murder of your entire team.

449
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,524
No, no, no, wait. Wait.

450
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:10,093
Get the president.
He'll tell you the truth.

451
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,362
There's somebody else behind this.
It wasn't me.

452
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,499
We're transporting you to a
protected location for arraignment

453
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,267
once you're cleared by the doctors.

454
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,370
What the fuck is wrong with you?

455
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:41,024
President Trumbull's
top guardian angel has fallen tonight.

456
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,727
Secret Service Agent Mike
Banning has been arrested...

457
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:46,630
Shocking revelations of
betrayal in President Trumbull's own team.

458
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,032
Banning,
who was rumored to be in line

459
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:52,369
to be the next Secret Service
director, was the mastermind...

460
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,404
Mike
Banning has been arrested...

461
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,273
Agent
Banning, why did you do this?

462
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,342
Assassination attempt...

463
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,643
Secret Service
Agent Mike Banning...

464
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,278
Mr. Banning! Mr. Banning,

465
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,380
is there any truth to the allegations?

466
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,782
And many
of his protection detail dead.

467
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:34,044
Mrs. Banning, why did your husband do it?

468
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,446
- Mrs. Banning.
- Mrs. Banning, can we get a statement?

469
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,488
Can we get a statement,
Mrs. Banning? How much did you know?

470
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,586
Thompson.

471
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,088
She just got home.

472
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,357
Put a car outside.

473
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,159
She's not in on this.

474
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,460
Phones are tapped,
so we'll give Banning

475
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,528
some rope to hang himself.

476
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,074
Hey! Wake the fuck up.

477
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,710
You're never sleeping again,
motherfucker.

478
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,746
Leave him alone, man.
You don't even know if he really did it.

479
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,648
The hell he didn't.

480
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,618
Trumbull was just starting
to turn things around, too.

481
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:42,079
I'm into all three motherboards.

482
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:45,182
Pulling their chains in three, two, one.

483
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,453
What the...

484
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,291
Thing just went dead.

485
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,436
Shit. Look.
The escort vehicles, too.

486
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,673
This ain't good, man.

487
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,311
Call it in.

488
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,313
How? The radio's...

489
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,548
Shit!

490
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,520
Ah!

491
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,364
What do we do? What do we do?

492
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,833
Hey! Hey!

493
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:39,636
Fuck!

494
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,445
No, no. No, wait.

495
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:50,280
Move!

496
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,669
Get out of the van.

497
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:16,540
Get out of there! Get out!
Move! Move!

498
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:17,807
Fucking move!

499
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,809
Fucking move! Move it!

500
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,548
Get on with it! Move!

501
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,817
Get the fuck in. Get in!

502
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:46,503
We're three minutes out.

503
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,939
Standing by.

504
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,482
So who are you guys anyway?

505
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,388
- Stop!
- Get him! Get him!

506
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,863
Get him off me!

507
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:14,998
Grab him! Grab him!

508
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,301
He got my gun!

509
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,976
Shit.

510
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,341
Hey. What the fuck, asshole?

511
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,711
He just kicked me down
the fucking stairs.

512
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,450
Fuck.

513
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:32,769
I told you you should've trained
like it was fucking real.

514
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,786
- Transport van...
- Oh, God.

515
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:53,456
Restraints...
Restraint bolts were cut with bolt cutters.

516
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:54,924
Fuck.

517
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:57,060
Get a wide here of the...

518
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,630
- Did you get this here?
- Still piecing together what happened,

519
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,800
- but Banning's gone.
- Shit, shit.

520
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,168
This was no cowboy hit.

521
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,569
It was tactical.

522
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,640
Okay.

523
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,075
Keep the search area wide.

524
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,077
Triple security
at all travel hubs

525
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,545
in the surrounding areas.

526
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,013
Banning is Secret Service.

527
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:19,149
He knows how we do this.
He knows all our tricks.

528
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:21,584
I want every surveillance
camera in the nation

529
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,453
going through
our facial recognition system.

530
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,455
Anything we see,
I want it followed up.

531
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:27,190
And I don't wanna hear anything
about a subpoena at this point,

532
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,558
'cause I really don't give a shit.

533
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,893
We will deal with that later.

534
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,461
We just found a crashed Suburban

535
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,962
near the ambush
with blood inside.

536
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,497
The VIN numbers
and plates were stripped.

537
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,766
- I wanna know if that's Banning's blood.
- Yes, ma'am.

538
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:41,471
Thompson.

539
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,509
Yes, sir. Thank you.

540
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:52,015
CID traced Banning's money back
to a state-owned bank in Moscow.

541
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:54,851
How 'bout that?

542
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,529
Renegade 607 confirming.

543
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,933
Falcon 904,
have you found Banning yet?

544
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,135
No, but we're on it.

545
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,538
We agreed to
keep Banning alive at the lake

546
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,173
so that he could take the fall.

547
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,842
Then you said you were
gonna make it look

548
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,577
like his team rescued him

549
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,979
and disappeared
with the 10 million.

550
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,015
And now, look.

551
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,917
You actually let him get away.

552
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,786
And he can expose us.

553
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:33,857
There's still enough evidence
to nail Mike as the mastermind.

554
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,228
The FBI have already ID'd
the evidence that we planted,

555
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,763
including his DNA in the van.

556
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:44,767
As we speak, they're also
connecting him to the money trail.

557
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:48,137
So let's not start panicking
and do something foolish.

558
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,240
"Foolish"?
I'm beginning to think

559
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:51,908
that your personal
connection to him

560
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,544
isn't an asset, but a liability.

561
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:58,515
If you want to benefit from this,
you will finish him for good

562
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,717
and pray Trumbull
never wakes up.

563
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,652
Your biggest mistake.

564
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:27,911
This is 1-800-collect.

565
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,846
You have a collect call from...

566
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:32,148
- Mike.
- Say yes to accept the charges.

567
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,651
- Yes, yes! Mike, is that you?
- Leah.

568
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,853
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

569
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:39,956
You okay? How's Lynne?

570
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,760
She's okay.

571
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:45,828
She's here with me.

572
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:49,098
We've been getting death threats.

573
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,306
- Are the cops out front?
- Yeah.

574
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:59,075
- And a ton of reporters.
- Okay, that's a good thing.

575
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,843
They'll watch the house 24/7.

576
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:03,112
So you just make sure
you stay inside

577
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,747
and they'll keep you safe.

578
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,752
Have they talked to you?

579
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:11,754
Yeah.

580
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,026
Why didn't you tell me
about the doctors?

581
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,698
Babe, I wanted to.

582
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,701
But I can't explain right now.
Just...

583
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,970
You got to trust me.

584
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,343
Where are you? Are you in jail?

585
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,880
Look, I'm not the only one
on the line.

586
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:41,684
Guys,
I know you got a job to do.

587
00:43:41,686 --> 00:43:42,885
So do I.

588
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:44,387
And I'm not gonna stop

589
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,055
until I prove
who really did this.

590
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:49,092
I just want you here,
home with me.

591
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,129
Me too.

592
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:57,334
We're gonna get through this, babe.

593
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,402
You hear me?

594
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,204
Yeah.

595
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,739
Yeah, I hear you.

596
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:05,942
Come on, Mike. Come on, come on.

597
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:08,745
High Mountain Militia.
Don't move.

598
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,053
Mike, who is that?

599
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:19,389
Hang up the phone now, mister.

600
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:21,824
Do it.

601
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,860
Now.

602
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,696
I got to go.

603
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:27,797
Do it!

604
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,233
I love you.

605
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:34,737
Mike.

606
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:35,972
We got it.

607
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,907
The truck stop on Highway 163.

608
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,276
Get every local unit in
the area and surround it.

609
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,011
Let's see those hands.
Turn around.

610
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,014
Holy shit.

611
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,417
We got us America's
Most Wanted here, Tim.

612
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,988
Bet there's a big ol' bounty
on your ass.

613
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,726
Tim, you stay on him. I'm gonna call it in.
If he moves, shoot him.

614
00:44:56,728 --> 00:45:00,163
Shit. He moves a
muscle, I'll light his ass up.

615
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,904
- You were saying?
- Shoot him, Tim.

616
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:09,972
Shoot him!

617
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:13,076
- Shit.
- What the hell you doing?

618
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,178
I ain't dying for this shit, Bobby.

619
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,314
- Goddamn it.
- Your mountain militia needs help.

620
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:21,250
You'd best drop that gun, boy.

621
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:24,220
Fuck.

622
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,458
Your keys in the truck?

623
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:31,327
What?

624
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,037
Fuck you!

625
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,075
Fuck!

626
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,920
Suspect is in a tractor trailer.

627
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,989
Backup is needed immediately.

628
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,873
Pull over the vehicle!

629
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:38,995
Pull over!

630
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:44,928
Pull over the vehicle!

631
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,912
Officer down! Officer down!

632
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,248
Shit!

633
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,853
Jesus Christ!

634
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,293
He's turning south on Vessel.
I repeat, south on Vessel.

635
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,935
Suspect is armed and dangerous.

636
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:20,369
Proceed with caution.

637
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:27,176
Three units in pursuit.
Backup is needed immediately.

638
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,346
This guy's crazy!

639
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:37,587
- Shit!
- We got him in sight.

640
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:39,055
South on Vessel.

641
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,463
Holy fucking shit!

642
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:01,978
Reverse! Move! Reverse!

643
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,946
- Christ.
- Get out of the fucking way!

644
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:07,516
- Move! Move!
- He's on a service road, west on Vessel.

645
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,886
Use caution
as it's an unmaintained...

646
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:26,783
Helicopter is on route.

647
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,514
He's headed down
a dirt road by mile marker 33.

648
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:43,452
Okay,
the chopper has him. Thank you.

649
00:48:52,664 --> 00:48:55,064
Mile marker 33.
All units converge.

650
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:05,308
Ah, shit. I've lost him.

651
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:46,015
Suspect has crashed.
Suspect has crashed.

652
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,050
Mile marker 34.

653
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,651
- Check the cab!
- Get a light over here!

654
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,253
Does anybody have any visual?

655
00:50:58,523 --> 00:50:59,789
Shit.

656
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:02,725
If those dogs haven't found him
yet, he's gone.

657
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,061
Fuck it. Just bring 'em in.

658
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:08,431
- Blood's back from the Suburban.
- Really?

659
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:11,534
None of it's Banning's.
In fact, no matches at all yet.

660
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,438
Any activity on his encrypted folder?

661
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,739
Nothing.

662
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:18,841
Fuck.

663
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:21,210
Hey! Hey! Hey.

664
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,511
Can I have a word? Hey!

665
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,630
Wanna talk to the
nice people from the press?

666
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:26,748
News 24! Can I have a word?

667
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,185
- No.
- No?

668
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:32,621
How solid is this intel

669
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:34,156
that Banning colluded
with the Russians?

670
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:35,591
It's tricky, sir.

671
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,326
The evidence definitely points to that,

672
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:39,662
but it's hard to prove
if it's really Moscow's doing

673
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:41,864
or an outside hacker
who wants it to look that way.

674
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:43,365
Outside hacker?

675
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:47,470
Hackers don't pay out $10
million for assassinations.

676
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:49,238
None have before, no.

677
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,709
The problem is the Russians will deny
this to the end if we take action.

678
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:57,880
But if we don't, they'll remain ambiguous
as to their involvement, so we look weak.

679
00:51:57,882 --> 00:51:59,482
Just like with their
election tampering.

680
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:02,251
I really think we should
slow down here, sir,

681
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,719
before this blows up in our face.

682
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,788
The president of
the United States

683
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,423
is lying in a coma,

684
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:09,892
and 18 Secret Service agents are dead.

685
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:12,661
This already blew up in our face!

686
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:32,615
A statewide manhunt
is under way for Secret Service agent...

687
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:34,850
A massive manhunt
for Banning has already begun.

688
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,552
His face will be
plastered everywhere,

689
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,554
so he won't be able
to use public transport.

690
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:41,924
What time did the police
call in the semi crash?

691
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:43,893
Scanner traffic pegs it at 4:17 a.m.

692
00:52:43,895 --> 00:52:47,663
That puts him at, what,
about a 200-mile range of the crash?

693
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,598
- Two-forty.
- Two-forty.

694
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,367
Okay, listen up, everybody.

695
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,602
Mike will have to find
somewhere to regroup.

696
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,204
Dig into his life.

697
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:58,240
Find out anything,
anyone that can hide him.

698
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,609
Every hour you don't
have an answer for me

699
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:02,778
is another hour
he's kicking our fucking ass.

700
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,527
How the fuck did you find me?

701
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:29,531
I run security for the president.
How do you think?

702
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,369
You've been here
the last five years.

703
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:35,271
North Carolina before that.

704
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,740
Alaska before that.

705
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:42,444
You see,
that's Big Brother for you.

706
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:47,283
No, actually, it was just me
wondering if you were still alive.

707
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:51,654
Did you do it?

708
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:55,958
You'd like it if I did,
wouldn't you...

709
00:54:56,927 --> 00:54:58,027
Dad?

710
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,403
I'm not gonna stay long.

711
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:09,738
Just need a place off-grid,
lie low for a bit.

712
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,778
- Hey, you got any water?
- Yeah.

713
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,016
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

714
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,385
So you run off your own power
source, water, everything?

715
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:24,520
Sure. Why not?

716
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,022
You stay attached to their tentacles,

717
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,857
they own you for life.

718
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:38,334
Fuck. Hey, you got any aspirin?
Something stronger?

719
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,669
I don't do medications.

720
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,738
Of course you don't.
And by the looks of it,

721
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,606
you shouldn't either.

722
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,611
What's this?

723
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,115
Writing your own manifesto?

724
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,918
You know, I've had
a lifetime to think about

725
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,420
the things I've seen and I've done.

726
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:02,391
I don't want to ever forget.
That's how we get lost.

727
00:56:02,393 --> 00:56:03,926
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

728
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:05,694
What chapter am I in?

729
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,435
Why are they saying it's you?

730
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,137
I was set up.

731
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:17,973
Not a surprise.
Fucking government.

732
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:20,743
No, not the government.

733
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:23,712
It was a friend of mine.
I'm trying to figure out who else.

734
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:26,582
Sounds like you should
pick better friends, son.

735
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:30,052
You know what?
Don't call me "son."

736
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33,789
You lost that right when you
walked out on Mom and me.

737
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,996
I know what I did.

738
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,400
But I'd do it again.

739
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:48,404
Because of what fucking war
made me, turned me into.

740
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:52,441
And I see it in you.
I can see it in your eyes.

741
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:56,645
You think Iraq was
different than Nam?

742
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,814
Nam different than Korea?

743
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:01,717
No, it's the fucking same thing!
It's war!

744
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:05,187
And it doesn't matter
what you give them.

745
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:08,857
You'll give it because
you don't know any better!

746
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,193
And they'll take it.

747
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:14,530
Your honor, your youth, your life!

748
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:31,180
Me disappearing was the best
thing that ever happened to you.

749
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,018
You wouldn't have liked me.

750
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:56,805
Good afternoon.

751
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:01,477
There has been no change in
President Trumbull's condition.

752
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:03,145
He remains in a coma.

753
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,048
And while
we pray for the best...

754
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:11,720
we must now recognize that the
world as we knew it has changed.

755
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:14,823
After careful and diligent work,
our intelligence communities

756
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:19,061
have unanimously concluded that
Secret Service agent Mike Banning

757
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:22,064
planned and carried out
the assassination attempt

758
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,799
on the president...

759
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:27,569
with full support from top levels...

760
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,872
of the Russian government.

761
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:32,140
Mr. President. Mr. President.

762
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,643
All options are on the table.

763
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:38,680
To that end,
I have just signed an executive order

764
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:42,951
calling for the use of a bold and
strong private contractor force

765
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,887
to be employed in our strategy.

766
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,956
Looks like we're finally
going back to work.

767
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:50,225
Found him!

768
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:54,062
- Talk to me.
- We hacked into Banning's government IP server

769
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:55,197
and compiled his search history.

770
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,765
Over his entire career,

771
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,300
Banning's been constantly monitoring this.

772
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:03,038
It's a social security number that's
collecting VA disability benefits.

773
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,239
Check this.

774
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,244
That's Clay Banning.
That's Mike's old man.

775
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:13,215
He told me all about him. He was a
decorated ranger in Nam and a tunnel rat.

776
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:16,785
He came back, he went crazy,
left everyone, and was gone.

777
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:19,254
Where's Daddy now?

778
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:22,824
West Virginia.

779
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,935
Mike. Mike.

780
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:35,237
Mike.

781
00:59:38,943 --> 00:59:42,711
- How long I been out?
- Long enough for your friend to find you.

782
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:43,979
Come on.

783
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:49,718
There. There.

784
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,820
- Shit.
- Yeah.

785
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:55,057
- There's at least 15 of them.
- Yeah.

786
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:57,125
I ain't gonna hold them off
with this pistol.

787
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,928
- We got to get outta here.
- I ain't going nowhere.

788
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,031
- What?
- No, no, this is my fucking mountain!

789
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:05,267
- No, don't go out there.
- Stay here if you want.

790
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,702
Shit.

791
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,674
- What are you doing?
- Open that up.

792
01:00:17,014 --> 01:00:18,280
What the...

793
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:23,118
Now, wait a minute.

794
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:25,721
Okay.

795
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:27,022
Why did I think coming here

796
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:28,690
was a good idea?

797
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:30,759
I knew you had time to kill,
but Jesus!

798
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:33,895
Just keep low and don't bitch.

799
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,874
What are you doing?

800
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,681
All right, you stay here.
I'm gonna go and draw them out.

801
01:00:52,683 --> 01:00:55,150
- No, no, I wouldn't.
- Why?

802
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,819
Old bull, young bull.

803
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:06,395
- What the fuck?
- That way! They're over there!

804
01:01:06,397 --> 01:01:11,033
- Great! Now they know where we are!
- Good. Fuck 'em.

805
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:17,105
Fuck!

806
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:23,278
- Okay, you stay here!
- What? Jesus Christ.

807
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:33,221
Are you kidding me?

808
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:51,873
Fuck!

809
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,830
Fucking crazy!

810
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:20,035
You almost blew me up, damn it!

811
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,337
I didn't tell you
to run down there.

812
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:25,874
Oh, shit.
Well, I hope you got more fun and games,

813
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,509
'cause we're about to be overrun!

814
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:29,745
- Go pull on that wire.
- What wire?

815
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:32,047
In the fucking leaves!
Where else?

816
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:33,949
- Fuck!
- Go get it!

817
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,888
Go!

818
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:02,144
Really?

819
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,346
You're welcome.

820
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:21,196
You need to hear this.

821
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:22,531
Our intelligence communities

822
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:24,299
have unanimously concluded

823
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,334
that Secret Service agent
Mike Banning

824
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,336
planned and carried out

825
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:30,872
the assassination attempt
on the president

826
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:35,277
with full support from top
levels of the Russian government.

827
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,445
This announcement
from Vice President Kirby...

828
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:41,116
- I told you they'd turn on you!
- You know, stop.

829
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:44,119
All right, just stop with
all your Big Brother shit.

830
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:47,155
Okay, your country didn't betray you!
You betrayed yourself!

831
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:50,058
What the fuck
do you know about it?

832
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:53,461
- I struggled all my life with this!
- What struggle?

833
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,163
You gave up!

834
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:07,509
You're right, son,
I did give up.

835
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:11,379
But sometimes it's better
to know when to quit

836
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,982
instead of lying to yourself...

837
01:04:13,984 --> 01:04:16,952
and hurting the ones you love.

838
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:33,101
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling a friend.

839
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,886
It's Frost.

840
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,155
No, it's not. Put him through.

841
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:57,259
Guess I should've
sent more guys, huh?

842
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:59,094
Why don't you come yourself?

843
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:01,496
Yeah, tell him to send
all the fuckheads he's got

844
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,932
in that shitty outfit of his!

845
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:12,240
Sounds like your dad's all fired up.

846
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,075
What happened to you, Wade?

847
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:18,280
- How did it come to this?
- Look, I wish it could've been different, Mike.

848
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:21,917
But war is about deception,
and Trumbull was in the way.

849
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,219
You were a necessary evil,

850
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,521
caught in the right place
at the right time.

851
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:29,124
Be thankful that
you're still breathing.

852
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,225
Fuck you.

853
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:33,328
So, what is it?
We get into another war

854
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:35,196
and you get your billions
in contracts?

855
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:37,265
You think it's about
the money, Mike?

856
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,367
No, I wish I could
trade places with you.

857
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,203
You're the one out there
fighting, fighting for life.

858
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:45,941
Can you feel it?
Blood pumping? Yeah.

859
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:51,546
Lions, Mike. Lions.
Now I get to have my fix, too.

860
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,282
Oh, you'll get your fix.

861
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,217
Don't worry about finding me.

862
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,386
I'll find you.

863
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:03,091
That's my Mike.

864
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,396
That's my Mike.

865
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:17,305
Has this ever been washed?

866
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,074
No. Does it fit?

867
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:22,444
- Hold this.
- Wait. That's all you're taking?

868
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:26,381
I ain't letting no bureaucratic
pricks read about my life.

869
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:34,656
- Oh, my God. You still got it.
- Yeah.

870
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:39,294
- She got an engine?
- She lights the tires.

871
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:54,175
The toll cameras
are just up ahead.

872
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:56,611
You sure about this?

873
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:57,746
Yeah.

874
01:06:57,748 --> 01:07:00,548
Well,
at least disguise yourself.

875
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,717
No. Then I look guilty.

876
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,087
Well, you already look guilty.
What the fuck's the difference?

877
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:15,030
HRT has cleared the cabin.

878
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,565
They say half the mountainside
was blown away.

879
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,467
Bodies lined up on the porch.

880
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:22,337
I wonder why Banning led us here.

881
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,815
Jesus.

882
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,752
This is a fucking mess.

883
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:41,689
"We work for Salient."

884
01:07:43,627 --> 01:07:48,163
- Salient Global, owned and operated by...
- Wade Jennings.

885
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:50,331
Yeah. You got a history?

886
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,435
I had to investigate
some of Salient's messes

887
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:55,170
when I was over in Iraq.

888
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:59,307
- Any positive IDs?
- These guys? No, not a one.

889
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:03,411
Again. Forensics says there's not a
single match in any Federal database.

890
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:07,849
What is this?
Is this Moscow tying up loose ends,

891
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,151
or is this Banning trying
to throw us off the trail?

892
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:16,124
All right.
What if Banning was being set up?

893
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:19,227
Who would have the
capabilities to pull this off,

894
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,829
and who would benefit the most?

895
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:23,598
Contract company like Salient.

896
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,567
Get in on the war machine.

897
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:27,869
I wanna dissect Salient.

898
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,370
I wanna know what communication

899
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:30,538
is flowing in, flowing out,

900
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,140
who they're tapped into,

901
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:33,475
who they're monitoring,
everybody.

902
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:37,779
And you know what?
Let's go rattle Wade Jennings' cage.

903
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,247
On it.

904
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,465
President Trumbull?

905
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,534
Can you open your eyes?

906
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,547
Is he coming out of it?

907
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,716
Well, it's too early
to say for certain.

908
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,451
But he's starting
to react to stimulus.

909
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:18,419
It shows me
he's trying to wake up.

910
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,722
You can go ahead and extubate.

911
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,459
According to inside sources,

912
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:26,928
President Trumbull is now
responding to stimulus.

913
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,731
Doctors aren't ready
to declare him out of danger,

914
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:33,535
but are hopeful that this is a sign that
he will fully recover from his coma.

915
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:36,404
More on Trumbull and what this
means to tensions with Russia later.

916
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:39,207
What's wrong?
I thought you'd be thrilled.

917
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:40,308
No, I am.

918
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:43,778
But Wade's not gonna quit
till he's dead.

919
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,414
Well, you can call in
and warn them.

920
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,683
Do you remember the part they think
I'm working with the Russians?

921
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:51,319
Besides, I don't know
who else is in on it.

922
01:09:52,422 --> 01:09:53,621
No.

923
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:57,192
I need to get to
the president himself.

924
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,861
Yeah. Then your own guys
shoot you.

925
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:01,896
Probably.

926
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:05,934
Shit. Leah and Lynne.

927
01:10:05,936 --> 01:10:08,536
Who are Leah and Lynne?

928
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:09,871
My wife and daughter.

929
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:14,375
You got a wife and a daughter?
Oh.

930
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:17,645
Yeah. Look.

931
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:20,982
I got to go, okay?
I got you involved enough.

932
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:24,252
Where you going?

933
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,420
I'm gonna steal this car.

934
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,455
Okay?

935
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:29,524
Yeah.

936
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,859
I'll see you around.

937
01:10:36,499 --> 01:10:37,632
Mike!

938
01:10:45,542 --> 01:10:47,809
President
Trumbull's improving condition...

939
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:50,645
calls into question the
retaliatory military response

940
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,480
set by Vice President Kirby.

941
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:56,818
Given Russia's aggression,
it's no time to re-posture.

942
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,953
America needs to show strength.

943
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:00,521
Still,
if and when President Trumbull

944
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,423
is back in command,

945
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,559
a reversal of Kirby's policy
could be at hand.

946
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,862
It's the secure number.

947
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:10,265
Renegade 607, confirming.

948
01:11:10,267 --> 01:11:11,733
Did you see the news?

949
01:11:11,735 --> 01:11:14,335
We have a contingency plan.

950
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:17,372
- It better work, or I cut rope.
- Excuse me?

951
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:19,907
Don't worry.
I know what you're capable of.

952
01:11:19,909 --> 01:11:21,576
That's why I chose you.

953
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:25,613
But don't you underestimate me
for a second.

954
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:29,651
There's a reason I've survived
Washington for this long.

955
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:35,423
It's time to take the gloves off
and make this country strong again.

956
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:37,892
The question is,
are you gonna be standing there with me?

957
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:40,328
Speaking of,
where is my contract?

958
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:42,664
I don't plant $10 million
dollars for shits and giggles.

959
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:45,433
It is right here, ready to send.

960
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:49,937
Finish the job, and your bet
will parlay into billions.

961
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:01,616
- You trust him to deliver?
- Just get the fucking job done!

962
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:03,518
What's going on
with our insurance policy?

963
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:07,989
It's happening as we speak.

964
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,627
Aw, here,
let me wipe that off. Here.

965
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:14,189
Here, you wanna
wipe your hands on that?

966
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,064
There, that's better.

967
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:22,637
What the fuck are you doing?

968
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,006
So sorry to alarm you, Leah.

969
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,109
So sorry to alarm you.

970
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:31,512
We snuck around the back
to avoid the press and police.

971
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,515
What the fuck are you doing in my house?
Get out of my house!

972
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,384
Wade Jennings sent us.

973
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:37,752
He heard from Mike
you're getting death threats

974
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:39,520
and asked us to escort you
to his compound.

975
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:41,856
What? I don't care who sent you!
Get out!

976
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,558
- Leah.
- It's okay.

977
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:48,730
Please. Please don't resist.

978
01:12:48,732 --> 01:12:52,834
For little Lynne here,
it's better we go quietly.

979
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,672
Okay. Okay.

980
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:00,742
Okay. Okay.

981
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:03,578
Okay. We're going.

982
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,980
I want Daddy!

983
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,515
All right, come on.

984
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,526
- Mommy.
- Ohh.

985
01:13:29,973 --> 01:13:33,775
This wasn't the way
I wanted to introduce myself.

986
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,544
I'm Clay Banning.

987
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,614
Mike's dad.

988
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:45,720
How... How...
How would I know it's you?

989
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:51,926
Well, the reason you don't
know that truth already is...

990
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,195
because of me alone.

991
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:58,699
Tell me something personal
about him.

992
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:07,175
The only thing
I have for you is...

993
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:08,976
his birth name.

994
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:15,516
Michael Jameson Banning.

995
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,888
Born on base, Fort Hood, Texas.

996
01:14:22,692 --> 01:14:24,792
His mother's maiden name...

997
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:32,700
Mary Alice... DeWitt.

998
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:42,109
And to this day,
I deeply regret walking away from them.

999
01:14:48,718 --> 01:14:50,551
That looks kind of deep.

1000
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:53,120
We should get it cleaned up.

1001
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,211
Sir?
What exactly do you remember?

1002
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:23,117
Some kind of drone attack.

1003
01:15:24,254 --> 01:15:26,153
I was floating in the water.

1004
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,758
A lot of my protection
team killed.

1005
01:15:34,264 --> 01:15:37,298
Do you remember where
Mike Banning was at the time, sir?

1006
01:15:40,003 --> 01:15:41,569
Was Mike killed?

1007
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:45,640
This is very difficult to say, sir.

1008
01:15:45,642 --> 01:15:48,876
We know how much you trusted him.
We all did.

1009
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,978
But we found that Mike
was hiding certain things

1010
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:53,247
from the Secret Service and you.

1011
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:56,918
What things?

1012
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,820
Both physical and mental issues.

1013
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:03,157
The FBI also has
substantial evidence

1014
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:05,126
that he was getting support
from the Kremlin.

1015
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:08,195
Including a $10 million payment.

1016
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:12,700
What else?

1017
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:17,572
Kirby's very close
to going to war

1018
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,774
with Russia over
the assassination attempt.

1019
01:16:22,011 --> 01:16:24,812
- Get him on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

1020
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:38,292
Okay, we found a way in.
No compromise.

1021
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:41,228
I don't pay you guys
enough money.

1022
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:42,997
We have an incoming helicopter.

1023
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:45,099
Get a camera on that.

1024
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:49,670
Salient, this is 145

1025
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:51,606
with the FBI on a matter
of national security.

1026
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:52,773
Permission to land.

1027
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:57,945
145, you're clear to land.

1028
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:11,692
Okay,
got a court order for the wiretaps...

1029
01:17:13,162 --> 01:17:16,163
and CID is looking at
the Salient servers now.

1030
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:19,700
Good. Now let's see
what he has to say.

1031
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:41,856
Mr. Jennings.
I'm Helen Thompson.

1032
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:44,992
I don't think
we've ever had the privilege.

1033
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:46,761
I wouldn't call it a privilege.

1034
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:53,300
Agent Thompson's the reason we're fighting
our wars with one hand tied to our dicks.

1035
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:57,104
So I guess you know
why we're here.

1036
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,173
You said it was
a matter of national security.

1037
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,876
Yeah. When was the last time
you spoke to Mike Banning?

1038
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:10,017
Well, if you're doing your job,
you'd know the answer to that.

1039
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,118
Oh, I do.

1040
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,854
Let's see if we've come up
with the same answer.

1041
01:18:35,778 --> 01:18:37,044
I am what I am.

1042
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:47,321
If Mike led her here,
the feds will be onto us.

1043
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:49,824
We're pulling the plug.

1044
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:51,492
The whole thing?

1045
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:52,960
Yeah, Salient's over.

1046
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:55,329
We're moving offshore.

1047
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,431
Roger. I'll crack the whip.

1048
01:18:57,433 --> 01:19:01,769
And on the way out,
we're making sure this gets done.

1049
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:03,471
No matter what...

1050
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:06,474
Trumbull's fucking dying today.

1051
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:25,159
The White House has just confirmed

1052
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:26,761
that acting President Martin Kirby

1053
01:19:26,763 --> 01:19:28,329
has made the unilateral decision

1054
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:30,264
to retaliate against Russia

1055
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,900
for the assassination attempt
on Allan Trumbull.

1056
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:38,305
Two forward, let's go.
Stop there, please.

1057
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:54,121
Hey.

1058
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:57,324
- I need you to get in the trunk.
- Okay.

1059
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:07,001
All units, 11-99. Need assistance.
We have a gunman outside the ER.

1060
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:09,804
We have a gunman outside the ER.

1061
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,339
Secure the ER.
And I wanna know who the fuck that is.

1062
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,308
All teams, close in, close in!

1063
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,409
Move it! Move!

1064
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:19,113
Go, go, go, go!

1065
01:20:19,115 --> 01:20:21,916
All units
converge on the first floor.

1066
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:33,427
Shots fired! Shots fired!
All available posts respond!

1067
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:34,528
Let's go!

1068
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,831
Unit six responding.

1069
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:44,505
Emergency room clear.

1070
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,040
No contact. All clear.

1071
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:47,374
ER's a mess.

1072
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,610
Thought I'd use
the elevators down here.

1073
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:52,479
Hey, I need to see
your face and ID. Hey!

1074
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:53,881
Don't move!

1075
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:57,184
- Mike?
- Hands in the air, Billy.

1076
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,054
- What the fuck?
- Sorry, Billy.

1077
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:01,889
You know we only put one guy

1078
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:03,811
outside the service elevator.
Go on. Turn around.

1079
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:20,641
- Gun!
- Put your weapon down!

1080
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:24,178
Boys, stay calm. Stay calm.
Stay calm, okay?

1081
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:27,882
Stay calm. Hey. Hey.

1082
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,316
I just need to speak to Gentry.

1083
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:30,484
Get me Gentry!

1084
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:32,920
He wants to speak
to the vice president now.

1085
01:21:32,922 --> 01:21:35,155
Gentry! Find him!

1086
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:38,559
I don't wanna fucking hurt anybody!
I just need to speak to Gentry!

1087
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,662
Gentry! David Gentry!

1088
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:43,330
Get me David Gentry!

1089
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:48,068
Put your weapon down now!

1090
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,608
Have you completely lost your mind?

1091
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:59,046
You have a true condition red here, David.
You need to get me to the president.

1092
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:04,485
Why the fuck would I give myself up?
This is a real fucking threat!

1093
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:10,658
What's happened, David?

1094
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,027
We just arrested
Mike Banning, sir.

1095
01:22:13,029 --> 01:22:15,529
He's saying
we have a condition red.

1096
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:18,098
Bring him to me.

1097
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,668
Sir, we really should wait
to speak with the DOJ first...

1098
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,936
Damn it, Sam!

1099
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:23,671
Bring him right now.

1100
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:27,107
Yes, sir.

1101
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:49,263
Sir. I know who did this to us.

1102
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:53,367
He's gonna try and finish the job.
You are not safe here, sir.

1103
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,135
No, no.
This is the safest place for you, sir.

1104
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,637
This place is on total lockdown.

1105
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,639
Then how the fuck
did I get here, Gentry?

1106
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,041
You know all of our protocols,
and now you are in cuffs!

1107
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:03,243
Sir, sir. I served with this man.
I know what he's capable of.

1108
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:04,545
- We don't even know if this guy exists.
- He wants you dead.

1109
01:23:04,547 --> 01:23:06,180
All we have is Mike's word!

1110
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:07,614
He will find a way
in here like I did.

1111
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:09,183
Eighteen agents are dead!
You're still alive!

1112
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:10,585
- We are sitting ducks.
- All right!

1113
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:16,156
Uncuff him.

1114
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:20,561
Sir, we still don't know
whose side Mike is really on.

1115
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:21,662
Yes, we do.

1116
01:23:23,733 --> 01:23:25,099
He's on my side.

1117
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:29,703
He's the reason I'm still alive.

1118
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:34,274
When you get to be president...

1119
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:37,745
you understand that being spit on,

1120
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:40,781
even betrayed,
comes with the job.

1121
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:45,586
But it shouldn't come with his
or any of yours.

1122
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:49,023
Now, uncuff him.

1123
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:57,564
Okay,
we need to recheck everything.

1124
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,199
And we need to get him
out of here now.

1125
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:00,734
Get Marine One inbound, okay.

1126
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,437
And do not tell anyone
outside of this room.

1127
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:05,773
Just do as Mike says.

1128
01:24:06,509 --> 01:24:08,342
- Sir.
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,064
We're 20 minutes out.

1130
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:27,194
Marine One's 30 minutes out.
God, it's taking too long.

1131
01:24:27,196 --> 01:24:29,063
The primary motorcade's ready.

1132
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:31,298
No, we're not going out the front.
It's too exposed.

1133
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:36,103
Command Post, outer,
middle and inner perimeters all clear.

1134
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:39,139
- Check snipers.
- They did, Mike.

1135
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:40,307
Check 'em again.

1136
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,411
Snipers, check in.

1137
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,815
Overwatch to Command Post.

1138
01:24:47,817 --> 01:24:49,183
All sectors clear.

1139
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:52,853
Oh.

1140
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:55,689
This stupid thing has crashed
six times in the last hour.

1141
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:57,591
Mine just did, too. It's weird.

1142
01:24:58,794 --> 01:25:00,360
Why is that weird?

1143
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:02,129
They were working
perfectly fine all week.

1144
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,665
In fact,
they rarely crash like this.

1145
01:25:07,369 --> 01:25:11,305
Hey, see if any IP addresses
from a Salient Global in Virginia

1146
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:12,873
are connected to this hospital.

1147
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:14,174
Do it.

1148
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:19,646
I'm not seeing anything.

1149
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:22,316
- Check for any breaches, any hacks.
- I'm on it.

1150
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:25,486
- Searching.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1151
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:41,301
- Where's that coming from?
- They connect to our oxygen lines.

1152
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,903
Okay, get on the phone,
see what's wrong.

1153
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:56,550
Somebody's controlling our gas
systems, and it's not us.

1154
01:25:58,721 --> 01:26:00,654
He's gonna blow this place.

1155
01:26:00,656 --> 01:26:03,157
I need the president ready
for transport up on the roof.

1156
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:04,825
No, no, no.
We can't wait for Marine One.

1157
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,894
We got to go low viz and use
the emergency vehicles.

1158
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:09,196
We're doing a full evac now.
Alert hospital security.

1159
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:10,764
I want Pathfinder ready to move.

1160
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:12,432
Beds 2 and 7.

1161
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:15,235
Stairwell nearest you.

1162
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:17,871
Saint Matthews
is being evacuated.

1163
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:20,874
Please exit the
building immediately. Attention.

1164
01:26:20,876 --> 01:26:22,876
Pathfinder's on the move.

1165
01:26:22,878 --> 01:26:24,678
Let's get some
monitors on battery packs.

1166
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,879
We're moving out.

1167
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:29,216
They discovered us.
They're evac-ing Saint Matthews.

1168
01:26:29,218 --> 01:26:30,817
Fucking Mike. I knew it.

1169
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:34,254
- How long before you can detonate?
- Four minutes.

1170
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:36,790
- You got eyes on Trumbull?
- Negative. We got the rest of the hospital,

1171
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:39,560
but Secret Service disabled the
ICU cams the second they arrived.

1172
01:26:39,562 --> 01:26:41,395
Well, find him.

1173
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:43,430
Teams Two and Three,
circle the perimeter.

1174
01:26:46,335 --> 01:26:48,368
Bellhop Nine,
what's the status of the threat?

1175
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:52,706
Someone's heating up the liquid
nitrogen to an unstable level.

1176
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,209
And we have pure O2
leaking down here.

1177
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,811
One spark and the explosion
can set off these tanks.

1178
01:26:57,813 --> 01:27:00,380
The blast could level the ICU
three times over.

1179
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,349
- Can't you just kill the power?
- It's too late, sir.

1180
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:04,351
- It could go at any time.
- Emergency vehicles ready!

1181
01:27:04,353 --> 01:27:05,552
- The garage secure?
- All secure.

1182
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:07,888
- We can't stop it.
- Shit!

1183
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,656
We can only speculate
it's some type of...

1184
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:10,824
The president is being evac'd now.

1185
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:12,326
Sir, if Trumbull is awake,

1186
01:27:12,328 --> 01:27:13,994
we're gonna need
his authorization

1187
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:15,996
before proceeding
with any kind of strike.

1188
01:27:15,998 --> 01:27:17,664
We don't even know
what condition he's in yet!

1189
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,366
With all due respect, sir,
we should speak

1190
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:21,702
to the attorney general
and get clarity.

1191
01:27:21,704 --> 01:27:23,770
The transfer of power
back to a president

1192
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:25,405
has never happened
in our nation's history.

1193
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,441
Which is exactly
why we do as I say

1194
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:29,009
until we hear otherwise.

1195
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:32,679
We stay with these op plans.
Am I clear?

1196
01:27:36,485 --> 01:27:38,418
- Is the road clear?
- Roger.

1197
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,387
We only have two extra
vests in this truck.

1198
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:44,291
Sir, I need you to put this on real quick.

1199
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:03,477
Step on it, Sims.
Get us away from this thing.

1200
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,380
There. Back street.

1201
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:09,983
Shit! Cover him!

1202
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:12,286
Jam their comms.
Take away their backup.

1203
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,787
Jamming Secret Service comms now.

1204
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,789
Back up, Sims.

1205
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,359
Fuck.

1206
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:21,628
Everybody out, passenger side!

1207
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,597
Go! Keep them pinned!

1208
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:24,865
Bury them under the rubble!

1209
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:31,772
Sir, we got to move. Go, go, go.
Stay behind the wheel.

1210
01:28:31,774 --> 01:28:33,573
Home Team, this is Leader Six.

1211
01:28:33,575 --> 01:28:35,542
We're taking heavy fire
south of the hospital.

1212
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:44,618
- This is Leader Six. Somebody answer me.
- Better move!

1213
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,557
This is Team Leader Six.
We have Pathfinder.

1214
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:53,660
We are taking heavy fire south of
the hospital. Does anybody copy?

1215
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:54,928
I'm getting nothing!

1216
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:57,798
We're almost to detonation.

1217
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,867
Hospital's about to go!
Keep them pinned!

1218
01:29:00,869 --> 01:29:02,536
Let's get to that building
over there!

1219
01:29:02,538 --> 01:29:04,438
This is Leader Six.
Somebody answer me!

1220
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,772
Listen to me, okay.
We're gonna make a move

1221
01:29:05,774 --> 01:29:07,407
and people are gonna fall.
Not you.

1222
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:09,109
- You keep moving, okay? Ready?
- Yeah.

1223
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:11,678
All right, let's go.
Everybody move! Go!

1224
01:29:23,425 --> 01:29:25,425
- Sam!
- Sir! Move! Move!

1225
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:41,375
Triggering the igniter now.

1226
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:48,014
Sir, go!

1227
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:20,814
Get out! Get out the back!

1228
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:23,583
Get the fuck out!

1229
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,485
This way.

1230
01:30:26,989 --> 01:30:28,088
All right.

1231
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:31,725
- Are you hit?
- I'm all right.

1232
01:30:35,898 --> 01:30:38,665
- Seal this fucking place off.
- Roger that.

1233
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:42,002
Does anybody read me?

1234
01:30:42,004 --> 01:30:43,970
We got a total comms blackout.

1235
01:30:43,972 --> 01:30:45,852
Does anybody have
a visual on Pathfinder?

1236
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,809
- How's the leg?
- I'll live.

1237
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:50,544
Look, I'm hearing nobody.
The comms are dead.

1238
01:30:50,546 --> 01:30:52,646
Wade saw us coming in here, too.

1239
01:30:52,648 --> 01:30:54,147
We need to find hard cover fast.

1240
01:30:57,753 --> 01:30:59,686
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

1241
01:30:59,688 --> 01:31:02,122
All right, sir, all right.
We got to go. We're moving!

1242
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,529
Build a barricade.

1243
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:13,467
Put them in front of
this corner office.

1244
01:31:20,676 --> 01:31:24,177
Does anyone copy?
Leader Six, do you have Pathfinder?

1245
01:31:30,152 --> 01:31:33,019
Alpha One, Team Two
circling back to rendezvous point.

1246
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:34,654
90 seconds.

1247
01:31:35,691 --> 01:31:36,790
Ah.

1248
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:39,192
Okay.

1249
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,563
Good? Okay.

1250
01:31:43,565 --> 01:31:45,265
- All right.
- Dead.

1251
01:31:46,735 --> 01:31:50,170
Okay. Got fresh mags in both.
Hand me your nine.

1252
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:54,040
- You sure this is gonna work?
- Has to. It's our only chance.

1253
01:31:54,042 --> 01:31:57,244
Just got to hold them off long
enough until our people get here.

1254
01:31:57,246 --> 01:31:58,578
Hopefully soon.

1255
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:03,116
Sir. I'll be back
before you know it.

1256
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:05,285
Mike.

1257
01:32:08,156 --> 01:32:09,256
Stay alive.

1258
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:11,925
Yes, sir.

1259
01:32:15,631 --> 01:32:17,797
- Run!
- Alpha One, Teams Two and Three

1260
01:32:17,799 --> 01:32:19,266
approaching rendezvous point.

1261
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:23,937
Heads up.
FBI, HRT and SWAT have been dispatched.

1262
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:25,906
And the National Guard's
been called in.

1263
01:32:25,908 --> 01:32:29,709
Half the country will be onto
this place in a matter of seconds.

1264
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:31,711
- Let's get the job done.
- Move!

1265
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:33,813
Move! Get out of the fucking way!

1266
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,653
Inside.

1267
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:41,988
I'll try to make sure
they don't flank you.

1268
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:44,791
Defend him with everything you got.

1269
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:11,017
They're in.

1270
01:33:22,731 --> 01:33:24,764
There. The corner office.

1271
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:25,966
Barricaded shooters.

1272
01:33:25,968 --> 01:33:28,802
Team Three, get around
the back hallway. Flank 'em.

1273
01:33:28,804 --> 01:33:31,237
Roger. Moving into position.

1274
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,350
Take open shots only.

1275
01:33:44,753 --> 01:33:45,852
Conserve ammo.

1276
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:51,358
Teams One and Two in position.
Go.

1277
01:33:57,833 --> 01:33:58,932
Damn!

1278
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:10,343
Fire!

1279
01:34:28,263 --> 01:34:29,663
Shit!

1280
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:33,733
Move right! Move right!

1281
01:34:38,974 --> 01:34:40,140
They got Will!

1282
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:52,352
Flush him out!

1283
01:34:57,392 --> 01:34:58,892
Shit!

1284
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:11,271
Keep moving! Keep moving!

1285
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:16,443
Bentley's gone!

1286
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,981
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

1287
01:35:21,983 --> 01:35:23,049
Last mag!

1288
01:35:23,051 --> 01:35:24,417
Let's fucking get 'em!

1289
01:35:42,003 --> 01:35:45,105
- I'm out!
- We need to fall back! Now!

1290
01:35:45,107 --> 01:35:46,272
Now!

1291
01:35:53,482 --> 01:35:54,781
Fuck.

1292
01:36:02,891 --> 01:36:04,858
You got a ton
of cops surrounding the building

1293
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,392
about to make entrance.

1294
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:08,461
- Set my extract.
- Roger.

1295
01:36:08,463 --> 01:36:09,929
Go! Go, go, go.

1296
01:36:43,498 --> 01:36:46,299
He fucked us.
Mike hid him somewhere else.

1297
01:36:47,502 --> 01:36:50,036
War is about deception. Go.

1298
01:37:08,123 --> 01:37:09,889
Hurry, get to your exfil.

1299
01:37:09,891 --> 01:37:11,457
The cops shut down
the south entrance.

1300
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:17,497
Police! Drop your weapons!

1301
01:37:17,499 --> 01:37:22,001
- On the ground!
- Drop your weapons now!

1302
01:37:24,206 --> 01:37:25,305
Police!

1303
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,043
Get on the ground now!

1304
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:32,612
Oh, shit.

1305
01:37:35,617 --> 01:37:38,451
- Lower your weapons right now!
- Get on the ground!

1306
01:37:38,453 --> 01:37:40,320
We have Pathfinder secure.

1307
01:38:55,330 --> 01:38:56,496
We're on the roof.

1308
01:39:17,585 --> 01:39:19,052
Fuck!

1309
01:39:30,699 --> 01:39:32,031
He's done. Let's go.

1310
01:39:32,434 --> 01:39:33,533
Come on.

1311
01:39:35,103 --> 01:39:36,469
Go on.

1312
01:39:36,471 --> 01:39:38,071
Fuck is wrong with you?

1313
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:39,572
Come on!

1314
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,659
Come on!

1315
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:04,230
Come on.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

1316
01:40:04,232 --> 01:40:05,431
Move!

1317
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:05,351
Ah!

1318
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:36,776
I'm glad it was you.

1319
01:43:44,752 --> 01:43:46,219
Lions.

1320
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:50,856
We're lions.

1321
01:44:31,799 --> 01:44:35,368
FBI officials have
dropped all charges against Mike Banning

1322
01:44:35,370 --> 01:44:37,703
and its allegations of
Moscow's involvement

1323
01:44:37,705 --> 01:44:39,405
in the assassination attempt.

1324
01:44:39,407 --> 01:44:41,641
While reinstated President
Allan Trumbull

1325
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:43,309
addressed the other world leaders

1326
01:44:43,311 --> 01:44:45,044
at the G20 in Hamburg yesterday,

1327
01:44:45,046 --> 01:44:47,280
easing tensions with Russia,

1328
01:44:47,282 --> 01:44:50,449
sources say indictments
against the real perpetrators

1329
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,451
are expected any moment.

1330
01:45:01,863 --> 01:45:05,564
Sir, welcome back.
I would've come to you.

1331
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:08,601
Ah, no worries, Martin.
You've been busy.

1332
01:45:08,603 --> 01:45:09,902
Have a seat.

1333
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,639
So, how are you feeling?

1334
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,675
Oh, today I'm feeling...

1335
01:45:17,845 --> 01:45:19,679
- presidential.
- That's great.

1336
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:21,747
Mm-hmm.

1337
01:45:21,749 --> 01:45:24,450
So, before she was gunned down,

1338
01:45:24,452 --> 01:45:27,453
a very heroic FBI agent
helped discover that...

1339
01:45:27,455 --> 01:45:33,092
Wade Jennings kept detailed
files of your dealings together.

1340
01:45:36,397 --> 01:45:38,497
- Did he?
- Insurance.

1341
01:45:38,499 --> 01:45:41,767
I really thought of keeping
you on just to fuck with you

1342
01:45:41,769 --> 01:45:43,536
over the next
three and a half years.

1343
01:45:44,706 --> 01:45:46,939
But that's the old way
of doing things.

1344
01:45:47,975 --> 01:45:49,075
David?

1345
01:45:50,611 --> 01:45:53,479
Since this is his last day
before retirement,

1346
01:45:53,481 --> 01:45:57,383
David gets the honor of marching
you right out the front door.

1347
01:46:03,124 --> 01:46:04,724
You're joking, right?

1348
01:46:06,994 --> 01:46:08,060
No.

1349
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:15,401
What's going on here?

1350
01:46:15,403 --> 01:46:16,836
Kirby, can you tell us anything?

1351
01:46:16,838 --> 01:46:18,678
Can you tell us anything
about what's happened?

1352
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:34,887
Eat them on the whole row.
Yeah. One, two...

1353
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:36,822
three.

1354
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:38,924
- Four.
- Four.

1355
01:46:40,027 --> 01:46:41,093
Five.

1356
01:46:41,095 --> 01:46:44,096
- Six.
- Yay!

1357
01:46:48,603 --> 01:46:50,035
What are your plans, Clay?

1358
01:46:51,038 --> 01:46:53,739
You know, I... I, uh...

1359
01:46:53,741 --> 01:46:55,541
I found a little RV,

1360
01:46:55,543 --> 01:46:59,111
and I thought I'd just
go mobile for a while.

1361
01:46:59,113 --> 01:47:03,549
Go up in north when it's summer
and go south when it's winter.

1362
01:47:08,823 --> 01:47:11,190
So we're not gonna see you
for a while then, huh?

1363
01:47:17,432 --> 01:47:19,932
No, you're gonna see
a lot of me, yeah.

1364
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:23,536
I'll just drive the RV over
here and park it out front.

1365
01:47:23,538 --> 01:47:25,638
I just don't want to
impose on you guys.

1366
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,440
You don't have to stay out
in the RV, Dad.

1367
01:47:27,442 --> 01:47:28,808
We got plenty of room in the house, huh?

1368
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:30,176
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1369
01:47:30,178 --> 01:47:31,877
No, we'd love
to have you around.

1370
01:47:31,879 --> 01:47:33,746
Yeah. Okay.

1371
01:47:35,983 --> 01:47:38,851
Thank you, Leah,
for that great breakfast.

1372
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:40,019
You're very welcome.

1373
01:47:40,955 --> 01:47:42,188
He's glad you're here.

1374
01:47:43,724 --> 01:47:44,824
We all are.

1375
01:47:44,826 --> 01:47:47,860
Just don't break
his heart again.

1376
01:47:48,996 --> 01:47:50,696
I need you to follow through.

1377
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,699
Yes, ma'am.

1378
01:47:55,102 --> 01:47:56,802
That's my intention.

1379
01:48:07,515 --> 01:48:08,581
Come in.

1380
01:48:10,852 --> 01:48:11,951
Hi, Mike.

1381
01:48:11,953 --> 01:48:13,552
How you doing?

1382
01:48:13,554 --> 01:48:15,194
- I'm healing up pretty good, sir.
- Good.

1383
01:48:15,957 --> 01:48:17,189
Go ahead, have a seat.

1384
01:48:20,228 --> 01:48:22,628
I hear there's something
you want to tell me.

1385
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:26,031
Yes, sir. I know you're busy,
so I'll get right to it.

1386
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:31,804
Before the attack, I...

1387
01:48:31,806 --> 01:48:37,576
I should've been more honest about some
of the things that I was dealing with.

1388
01:48:37,578 --> 01:48:40,779
The concussions, the... pills.

1389
01:48:43,851 --> 01:48:45,117
I let you down, sir.

1390
01:48:47,588 --> 01:48:48,721
You're damn right.

1391
01:48:50,258 --> 01:48:53,626
Why did you think you
couldn't come to me with this

1392
01:48:53,628 --> 01:48:55,561
after all we've been through?

1393
01:48:55,563 --> 01:48:59,598
I don't know, sir.
You know how I feel about the job, and I...

1394
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,535
I didn't want anyone
to take that away from me.

1395
01:49:03,838 --> 01:49:05,804
But that is no excuse.

1396
01:49:08,676 --> 01:49:10,309
You know,
someone said to me once...

1397
01:49:11,846 --> 01:49:13,946
it's better sometimes
knowing when to quit...

1398
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:18,651
instead of lying to yourself and hurting
the ones you care about the most.

1399
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:21,587
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

1400
01:49:24,025 --> 01:49:26,025
I'm here to offer
my resignation, sir.

1401
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:50,049
Mike...

1402
01:49:54,188 --> 01:49:57,890
it's our moments of struggle
that define us.

1403
01:49:59,627 --> 01:50:02,294
How we handle them
is what matters.

1404
01:50:02,296 --> 01:50:04,196
Like I said in the hospital...

1405
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:07,866
I'm still alive
because you didn't quit.

1406
01:50:07,868 --> 01:50:12,137
If you choose to do so now,
now that's up to you.

1407
01:50:13,174 --> 01:50:15,307
But I still want you for director.

1408
01:50:17,645 --> 01:50:18,777
If you want it.

1409
01:50:26,153 --> 01:50:27,653
No more secrets.

1410
01:50:34,095 --> 01:50:35,394
No more secrets, sir.

1411
01:50:38,933 --> 01:50:40,032
Good.

1412
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,334
Very good.

1413
01:50:48,943 --> 01:50:50,109
Thank you, sir.

1414
01:51:11,966 --> 01:51:14,900
You know, that's a good
thing you got off those pills

1415
01:51:14,902 --> 01:51:16,935
and you got your physical done.

1416
01:51:16,937 --> 01:51:20,272
But you got a whole lot
of shit going on upstairs.

1417
01:51:20,274 --> 01:51:23,308
You know, the stuff
we've been through,

1418
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:26,145
it sits up there
in the top of your head

1419
01:51:27,148 --> 01:51:29,081
like it's going to explode.

1420
01:51:29,083 --> 01:51:31,817
If you don't deal with it,
it'll eat you up.

1421
01:51:32,687 --> 01:51:33,986
Seriously, Dad?

1422
01:51:33,988 --> 01:51:37,356
You're telling me that I have
to take care of my upstairs?

1423
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:41,460
- Yup.
- You're like one level off of the Unabomber.

1424
01:51:41,462 --> 01:51:43,328
Tell you what,

1425
01:51:43,330 --> 01:51:45,097
you wanna help me
get my shit together?

1426
01:51:45,099 --> 01:51:46,198
Yeah.

1427
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,934
So, how about you come with me?

1428
01:51:48,936 --> 01:51:50,402
We get un-fucked together.

1429
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:52,404
Where are we going?

1430
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:55,441
This place my doctor's
sending me to.

1431
01:51:55,443 --> 01:51:57,409
It's supposed to
rebalance your brain.

1432
01:51:58,179 --> 01:51:59,745
Oh, shit.

1433
01:52:02,316 --> 01:52:06,185
Our goal here is to increase
your powers of control.

1434
01:52:06,187 --> 01:52:09,955
All of your negative energy melts
away in the zero gravity tank

1435
01:52:09,957 --> 01:52:13,726
while activating
your core feelings of love

1436
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:15,127
and centeredness,

1437
01:52:15,129 --> 01:52:17,296
keeping your mind dreamily alert

1438
01:52:17,298 --> 01:52:19,832
just above the portal of sleep.

1439
01:52:19,834 --> 01:52:23,736
We call this threshold
"theta state."

1440
01:52:27,975 --> 01:52:30,776
- Hey... let's give it a try.
- Ah.

1441
01:52:32,747 --> 01:52:33,846
Come on.

1442
01:52:33,848 --> 01:52:38,183
- Okay. All right. Fine.
- All right.

1443
01:52:43,491 --> 01:52:44,923
Oh.

1444
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:48,761
Hey, this is all right.

1445
01:52:50,831 --> 01:52:52,197
Ohh.

1446
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:57,136
What? Wait! Hold it!

1447
01:52:57,138 --> 01:52:58,837
Okay, okay, get me outta here!

1448
01:52:58,839 --> 01:53:00,305
No fucking way!

1449
01:53:00,307 --> 01:53:02,474
- Turn the lights on!
- Sorry, Dad.

1450
01:53:02,476 --> 01:53:05,410
And you thought this was
gonna be a bonding experience?

1451
01:53:06,013 --> 01:53:07,346
Oh.

1452
01:53:07,348 --> 01:53:08,947
I'm gonna pee in here.
